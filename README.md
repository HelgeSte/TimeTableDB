My own Java version of a MVC project from a internet services course at UiA. This project is mostly done as a part of self-education in Java.
In this project, MySQL was used for database. Code from Core Java Fundamentals Volume 2, 12th edition, was used for the DbUtilitites file. 
It doesn't have a gui or web-ui, and Junit testing was used for testing the functionality of the project.
My plan is to learn to use Spring and use it to setup a browser interface.
