A Java version of a MVC project from a internet services course at the University of Agder. This project was is coded from scratch though, but it's made to be quite similar to the UiA project. This project is mostly done as a part of self-education in Java.

In this project, MySQL was used for database. Code from Core Java Fundamentals Volume 2, 12th edition, was used for the DbUtilitites file. 
It doesn't have a gui or web-ui, and Junit testing was used for testing the functionality of the project.
My plan is to learn to use Spring and use it to setup a browser interface.
